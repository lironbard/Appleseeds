        // Instructions
        // 1. Create an object called ‘mycountry’ for a country of your choice,
        // containing properties ‘country’, ‘capital’, ‘language’, ‘population’
        // and ‘neighbours’ (an array)
        // 2. Add a method to the object called 'describe' to the 'myCountry'
        // object. With the help of the ‘this’ keyword, this method will log a
        // string like this to the console:
        // ‘Finland has 6 million people, their mother tongue is Finnish, they
        // have 3 neighbouring countries and a capital called Helsinki’.
        // 3. Call the ‘descrbie method’.
        // 4. Add a method called 'checkIsland' to the 'myCountry' object.
        // This method will set a new property on the object, called 'isIsland'.
        // 'isIsland' will be true if there are no neighbouring countries, and
        // false if there are. Use the ternary operator to set the property

        const mycountry = {
            country: "England",
            capital: "London",
            language: "English",
            population: 56,
            neighbours: 1,

            describe: function(countries) {
                console.log(`${mycountry.country} has ${mycountry.population} million people, their mother tongue is ${mycountry.language}, they have ${mycountry.neighbours} neighbouring countries and a capital called ${mycountry.capital}`);
            },

            checkIsland: function() {
                this.neighbours.length > 0 ? this.isIsland = true : this.isIsland = false;
            }
        }

        console.log(mycountry.describe());
        mycountry.checkIsland();
        console.log(mycountry);
