        // John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games,
        // John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94
        // and 123 points.
        // 1. Calculate the average score for each team
        // 2. Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the
        // winner to the console. Also include the average score in the output.
        // 3. Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into
        // account there might be a draw (the same average score)
        // 4. EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105
        // points. Like before, log the average winner to the console.
        // 5. Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in
        // mind there might be draws.
