        // Create a JS function to determine whether or not a given year is a leap year.
        // The function should take a year as an argument:
        // 1) Determine whether or not it is a leap year
        //  * If the given year is a leap year, the program should print "It is indeed a
        //  leap year", otherwise the program will print "This is not a leap year."Help:
        // every year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year except for the ones that are
        //  also divisible by 100, unless it is divisible by 400. Example: 2012 is a leap
        //  year 2100 is not But 2400 is.
