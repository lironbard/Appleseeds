        // 1. create 2 book objects with properties: name, author, year.
        // 2. create an empty object bookUtils (utils = short for utilities).
        // 3. add to to the bookUtils object a function getFirstPublished, that recieves 2
        // books and returns the book with the smaller year.
        // 4. add to to the bookUtils object a function setNewEdition, that recieves a
        // book and an edition year and sets a new property latestEdition with the
        // edition year, or updates an existing one.
        // 5. add to to the bookUtils object a setLanguage function, that recieves a book
        // and a language and sets a new property language with the languahe, or
        // updates an existing one.
        // 6. add to to the bookUtils object a setTranslation function, that recieves a
        // book a language and a translator, and sets a new property of translation,
        // which is an object that contains the translator and the language.
        // 7. add to to the bookUtils object a setPublisher function, that recieves a book
        // a name and a location, and sets a new property named publisher, which is an
        // object that contains the name and location.
        // 8. add to to the bookUtils object a function isSamePublisher, that recieves 2
        // books and checks if the publisher name and location are identical in the 2
        // books
